# TODO
- [ ] [meta] avoid touching generated headers if its contents are identical to avoid recompilation of cpp files that include them
    - might affect dependency and dirty tracking in ninja; touch a companion stamp file and depend on those instead
    - work started in hashing branch
- [ ] [compdb] generate for CMake sub-targets


# DONE
- [x] [meta] depfile for generated header
    - re-using cpp -> o.d files does not work because they are specific to the output file
    - I might need meta to generate its own depfile, hopefully LLVM/libclang has support for this built in, or clang bin has flags to generate just the depfiles without any other compilation
- [x] resolve subcategories into parent/child hierarchy
    - e.g. for meta(tests.cpp) to auto-regenerate based on all the #includes its doing
- [x] meta depfile support
- [x] move generated header folders into target src dirs
    - each target needs to be able to just #include "gen/file" and not have things polluted by outside targets
    - I want to be able to commit the generated headers, allowing better change tracking and distribution
